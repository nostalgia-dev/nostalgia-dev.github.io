nostalgia enables combining ALL personal data you might have, and bring them together to give you unlimited insights into yourself.

You will be able to relive experiences much more easily as well, as all your data can be viewed at once. For example, during a concert: messages sent, pictures made, expenses, heartrate and so on.

I was able to find a post I was looking for by remembering where I was at that same and using that to filter my brower history using nostalgia.
