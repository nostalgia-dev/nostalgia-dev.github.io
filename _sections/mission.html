  Some <span style="font-weight: 900">companies know everything</span> about you! That is not okay in this era in which privacy and data ownership for the consumers became a mainstream issue.
  But let's not worry about that for just a second and instead wonder: <br/> <span style="font-weight: 900">why do we not have the same powers?</span>
</p>

<p>nostalgia provides a <span style="font-weight: 900">platform</span> for combining ALL your personal data to provide you with all the <span style="font-weight: 900">insights</span> into yourself.</p>

<p>This movement is driven by GDPR rulings in Europe which more or less force companies to provide you with your personal data.<br> For the first time in history, having data can be a liability.</p>

<p> </p>

<ul style="text-align:left; margin-left: 1rem">
  Features:
  <li>Relive experiences much more easily, as all your data can be viewed at once using a Timeline.</li>
  <li>For example, during a concert: messages sent, pictures made, expenses, heartrate and so on.</li>
  <li>Find lost articles you've read by remembering where you were then and use that knowledge to filter e.g. your browser history.</li>
</ul>
